## 📝 Project Overview
This project involved the professional development of a Salesforce solution that is designed to manage the core operations of a car rental business through two dedicated applications — one for customer service and one for vehicle maintenance. This project demonstrates my ability to plan and implement a complete CRM system using Salesforce tools, including custom data modeling, flows, automation, dashboards, and user-centered design.

The system supports real-world business processes such as rental agreement creation, payment handling, vehicle maintenance scheduling, and service history tracking. Each app is tailored to the daily responsibilities of its intended user, providing a clear, streamlined experience backed by automation and a user friendly platform.
